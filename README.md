This is 'original' clock has been written for my HW.


Clock constructor takes 2 arguments, type and element.
Clock type you can see underneath this block.
Element responsible for view & events. It is easy in use!

__How to implement clock to the code__
```
var clock = new Clock(CLOCK_TYPE, ELEMENT); 
```

__Clock has three types (string)__
```
- Short (H:i)
- Long (H:i:s)
- Date (Y-m-d)
```
